### What are the different CPS operated by the Reserve Bank?
The Reserve Bank owns and operates following CPS:

i. Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) System – It is the country’s Large Value Payment System and was introduced in March 2004. It was subsequently enhanced to Next Generation-RTGS (NG-RTGS) built on the ISO 20022 standard with advanced features such as hybrid functionality, liquidity management functions, future date functionality, scalability, etc. The transactions settle real-time on a gross basis in the books of RBI and have a floor value of Rs. 2 lakh. RTGS also settles Multilateral Net Settlement Batch (MNSB) files emanating from ancillary payment systems such as CCIL and NPCI. It is available round the clock on all days of the year with effect from December 14, 2020.

ii. National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT) system – It is a retail payment system and was introduced in November 2005. NEFT has a straight through process which operates in 48 half-hourly batches 24x7x365 with effect from December 16, 2019. There is no floor or ceiling for the amount that can be transferred in a single transaction, because of which NEFT has emerged as a popular hybrid payment system.
