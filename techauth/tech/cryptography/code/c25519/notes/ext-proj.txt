Question
-----------
I am trying to understand point addition in RFC8032 section 5.1.4, which references
the paper "Twisted Edwards Curves Revisited" (https://eprint.iacr.org/2008/522.pdf)
to describe the quick way they perform twisted Edwards curve addition with fewer inversions.

I am reading through the paper and it makes sense until I get to the statement
in section 3.1 under figure (5), which says that the unified addition formulae for
extended coordinates are somehow derived from the affine addition formulae in figure (1).
I cannot for the life of me understand how the formula

    X3 = (X1Y2 + Y1X2) (Z1Z2 − dT1T2)
can be derived from the formula
    X3 = (X1Y2 + Y1X2) / (1 + dT1T2)
even with the extended coordinates, and dividing every X1 or Y1 by Z1.
Can anyone explain their derivation to me?

Answer

To convert extended twisted Edwards coordinates to extended projective coordinates
one needs to divide

X3 = (X1Y2 + Y1X2)(Z1Z2 - dT1T2)
by
Z3 = (Z1Z2 − dT1T2)(Z1Z2 + dT1T2)

𝑋3/𝑍3 = (X1Y2 + Y1X2) (Z1Z2 - dT1T2)/(Z1Z2 - dT1T2)(Z1Z2 + dT1T2) //cancels
      = (X1Y2 + Y1X2)(Z1Z2 + dT1T2)
      = ((X1Y2 + Y1X2)/Z1Z2) / ((Z1Z2 + dT1T2)/Z1Z2)              // 1. divide by Z1Z2
      = (X1Y2/Z1Z2 + 𝑌1𝑋2/Z1Z2) / (Z1Z2/Z1Z2 + dT1T2/Z1Z2)        // use X/Z -> X, Y/Z -> Y
      = (X1Y2+Y1X2)/(1+dT1T2)


Step 1 is the confusing step, the coordinates are still in the
extended twisted Edwards coordinates need to be translated.

... so:
X in the extended coordinates is equal to (the affine x)/Z,
Y in the extended is equal to (the affine y) / Z,
Z in the extended coordinates is equal to Z * Z, and
T in the extended coordinates is equal to (the affine x * the affine y) / Z.

I think I got confused when the paper said that (X : Y : Z) can be passed from the
projective coordinates to the extended coordinates by computing T as XY instead of XY / Z;
Z was probably understood to be 1 most of the time when passing from projective to extended.

It is completely agreeable to have confusion since they both use the same letters that
is hard to follow...
